### My Projects

- [Project 1: Adjusted Stock Price Series](https://github.com/Arun-Lama/Nepse-Adjusted-Price)
  - On the ex-dividend date, a company's stock price typically drops by an amount equal to the dividend being paid. This happens because buyers after this date won't receive the dividend, making the stock less valuable to them.
  - The adjusted price series may not be readily available to the retail traders, especially in a least-developed market like Nepal. This program generates adjusted price series from unadjusted OHLC price series. The dividends history and rights history are also required to make price adjustments.
  - ![Unadjusted vs adjusted chart of Nepal Life Insurance Company Ltd. (NLIC)](images/unadjusted%20vs%20adjusted.png)
  - I take pride in this project as it demanded a significant amount of time and posed occasional logical challenges. I employed the back-adjusted approach for the necessary adjustments.

- [Project 2: Technical Strategy Backtesting](https://github.com/Arun-Lama/technical-analysis-backtesting-nepse)
  - I wanted to test a simple trading strategy comprising of MA-20, MACD, and RSI. I developed my own backtesting system.
  - Rule of the strategy:
    - Buy: When price is above 20 MA, RSI is above 50, and MACD line is above signal line.
    - Sell: When price is below 20 MA, RSI is below 50, and MACD line is below signal line.
  - ![This is how it looks when the backtested results are compared with buy and hold.](images/backtesting.png)
  - The adjusted price series generated in project 1 was used as input price series for this project.

- Project 3: Stock Broker Turnover Racing Bar Chart
  - I used Bar_chart_race library for this visualization.

- Project 4: Word Cloud Viz based on News Headings of two financial websites
  - News titles for the specified time period from sharesansar.com and merolagani.com can be scraped to create this visualization.
